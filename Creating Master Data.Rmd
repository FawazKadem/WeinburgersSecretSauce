#### This is an exact replica of adrians code with the last line added. Didnt want to add it onto adrians file

%% BASE DATA WRANGLING

Load libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
```

Import JSON data to a datatable
```{r}
data <- fromJSON("train.json")
head(data)
```

Create LONG version of the data (split ingredients column into seperate rows with duplicated id and cuisine values)
```{r}
#using the unnest function from tidyr does this very well
dataLong <- unnest(data, ingredients)
head(dataLong)
```

Create WIDE version of data (spread ingredients across columns to make dummy variables)
```{r}
dataTidy <- dataLong %>%
  mutate(yesno = 1) %>%
  distinct %>%
  spread(ingredients, yesno, fill = 0)

head(dataTidy)
```

```{r}
write.csv(dataTidy, file = "cookingDataMaster.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
